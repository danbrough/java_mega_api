<h2>MEGA LIMITED TERMS OF USE ("TERMS")</h2>

<p>
	1. Welcome to MEGA. We are an Internet services provider and provide
	services made available at our website at https://mega.co.nz,
	subdomains and related sites ("website"), which enables users
	(depending which MEGA plan they are on), amongst other things, to
	encrypt by way of user controlled encryption ("UCE"), use our
	application programming interface ("API"), upload, store, manage,
	download and decrypt files, information, material and other data
	("data") and give access to that data to others (all together,
	services). If you have questions about how to use our services or the
	great things you can do with Mega, see our <a href="#help">FAQ</a>
	first.
</p>
<p>2. These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services
	and website by you and anyone that you allow to access your data or our
	services. By using our services or the website, you and they
	irrevocably agree to these terms. If you do not like these terms or
	don't want to be bound, you can't use our services and the website.</p>
<p>3. We can change these terms at any time and we will provide you
	notice of the change, whether via our website, by sending you an email
	or via any messaging service we provide. Your continued use after that
	notice means that you agree to the changed terms.</p>
<p>4. If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a
	non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use
	our service via the website in accordance with these terms and any plan
	you have subscribed for.</p>
<h2>Your data</h2>
<p>5. If you allow others to access your data (e.g. by, amongst
	other things, giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data),
	in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for
	their actions and omissions while they are using the website and
	services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss,
	damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if
	they breach any of these terms.</p>
<p>6. Our service includes UCE. You should keep your encryption keys
	safe and confidential and not release them to anyone unless you wish
	them to have access to your data. If you lose or misplace your
	encryption keys, you will lose access to your data. We strongly urge
	you to use robust anti-virus and firewall protection.</p>
<p>7. You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our
	service. We do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of
	data or the services will be bug free. You are completely responsible
	to remove all data prior to termination of services.</p>
<p>8. Our service may automatically delete a piece of data you
	upload or give someone else access to where it determines that that
	data is an exact duplicate of original data already on our service. In
	that case, you will access that original data.</p>
<p>9. We will store your data on our service subject to these terms
	and any plan you subscribe to. If you choose to stop using our
	services, you need to make sure you retrieve your data first because,
	after that, we may, if we wish, delete it. If we suspend our services
	to you because you or someone you have given access to has breached
	these terms, during the term of that suspension, we may if we wish deny
	you access to your data. If we terminate our services to you because
	you or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, we
	may if we wish delete your data immediately. In circumstances where we
	cease providing all our services for other reasons, we will, if
	reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law from doing so,
	give you 30 days access to retrieve your data.</p>
<h2>What does it cost you?</h2>
<p>10. Once you have purchased a plan for our services, you need to
	pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties). We
	can also change the fees for our services at any time if we give you
	notice. You can't withhold payment for any reason or claim any set-off
	without getting our written agreement.</p>
<p>11. If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are
	supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect
	any other rights we may have against you)...</p>
<p>11.1 ...make you pay, on demand, default interest on any amount
	you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date
	when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by
	you. You will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our
